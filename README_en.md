Eat Chino
</h1>

[简体中文](./README.md) | English

<br>

## Introduction
Idea From: [EatKano](https://github.com/arcxingye/EatKano)  

[Official Website](https://gochiusa.com/bloom/)
| [GitHub Pages](https://miyakowww.github.io/eat-chino/)  

I re-implemented it with native Web because I haven't learned PHP yet.

<br>

## Features
Infinite mode only. (Maybe I'll add more later)
